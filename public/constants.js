    "What is HackBU?":

      "This event is open to all students 18 and older. You don't need to be a computer science major or even a Binghamton University student to participate!",

    "How much does it cost?":
      "HackBU is a free event! This means that all you'll need is a computer to work on, an internet connection, and an idea! In fact, we'll be giving you free swag at the end of the hackathon for participating!",

    "Do I need a team or idea to sign up?":
      "No! We recommend registering with friends, but there will be opportunities to brainstorm with and meet other participants at the hackathon.",

    "What if I'm a newbie?":
      "This is going to be our most beginner-friendly event yet. We are going to have workshops both before and during the hackathon in order to get you in a position to be able to work on a project. We are hoping for any student of any major to be able to participate in our hackathon.",
